            <strong>P2P Media Loader</strong> is an open-source JavaScript library
            that uses features of modern web browsers (i.e. HTML5 video and WebRTC)
            to deliver media over P2P and do playback via integrations with many
            popular HTML5 video players. It doesnâ€™t require any web browser plugins
            or add-ons to function.
          </p>
          <p><strong>P2P Media Loader</strong> web browser requirements are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>WebRTC Data Channels</strong> support to exchange data between
              peers

              <strong>Media Source Extensions</strong> or <strong

          P2P Media Loader is configured to use public STUN and WebTorrent
          servers by default. It means that it is not required to run any
          server-side software for the P2P network to function.
        </p>
        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <p>
          A web browser runs a video player integrated with P2P Media Loader
          library. An instance of P2P Media Loader is called peer. Many peers
          form the P2P network.
        </p>
        <p>
          P2P Media Loader starts to download initial media segments over
          HTTP(S) from source server or CDN. This allows beginning media
          playback faster. Also, in case of no peers, it will continue to
          download segments over HTTP(S) that will not differ from traditional
          media stream download over HTTP.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that P2P Media Loader sends media stream details and its
          connection details (ICE candidates) to WebTorrent trackers and obtains
          from them list of other peers that are downloading the same media
          stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          P2P Media Loader connects and starts to download media segments from
          the obtained peers as well as sharing already downloaded segments to
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          From time to time random peers from the P2P swarm download new
          segments over HTTP(S) and share them to others over P2P.
        </p>
